  Currently, I can't get enough of the song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/26ZzSLUJMmYp5u1hDELEWH">Transgender</a> by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7K3zpFXBvPcvzhj7zlGJdO">Crystal Castles</a> on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/9qz2xtkur2fengfsdcq8dd907?si=kq2SVrUkSNe0z1NJjpt7kg">Spotify</a>.

  My most listened genre is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=electro-industrial music">electro-industrial</a>.
  Still, I've been listening to a lot of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=drift phonk music">drift phonk</a> lately.
