  Currently, I can't get enough of the song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0O26gtfjuscAOnQobjNPPL">To the Hellfire</a> by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6vXYoy8ouRVib302zxaxFF">Lorna Shore</a> on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/9qz2xtkur2fengfsdcq8dd907?si=kq2SVrUkSNe0z1NJjpt7kg">Spotify</a>.

  My most listened genre is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=aggrotech music">aggrotech</a>.
  Still, I've been listening to a lot of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swedish metal music">swedish metal</a> lately.
